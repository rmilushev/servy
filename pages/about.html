   NASI LEMAK

With roots in Malay culture, its name literally means "oily/ fatty rice" but in context is defined "rich" and "creamy"--this name is derived directly from the cooking process where the rice is soaked in coconut cream and is steamed and is often accompanied with pandan leaves, giving it an amazing flavor and fragrance.

Traditionally Nasi Lemak is served with hot spicy sauce (sambal) which is ground chilli paste--cooked in oil and added with a range of garnishes- cucumber slices, small fried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts and some sliced hard-boiled egg or you have the option of also choosing fried egg.
